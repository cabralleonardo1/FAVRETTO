<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated development of the SISTEMA WEB DE ORÇAMENTO E PEDIDOS FAVRETTO application. It started by building core client and budget management functionalities, including a UI based on Shadcn components and a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. Key architectural decisions include using UUIDs, timezone-aware datetimes, and strict adherence to environment variable usage for URLs. The engineer progressively added features such as price table management (CRUD, import, export, access control), comprehensive budget creation with dynamic fields (colors, print percentage, area/volume calculation), and a budget history/management module. The most recent focus has shifted to implementing seller management and commission features, but the process is currently paused on debugging reported errors related to seller registration and budget functionalities, indicating a need for thorough investigation and correction.

    *   Add Porcentagem de Impressão (print percentage) with numeric validation.
    *   Calculate Área/Volume em M² (area/volume in m²) as .
    *   Calculate Preço Final based on .
    *   Support for length, height, and width in meters with two decimal precision.
3.  **Price Table Management:** CRUD operations for items, import from Excel, visualization, printing, and PDF export. Access control for operators.
4.  **Budget History & Revisit:**
